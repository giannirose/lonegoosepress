This navigates to the links that you create here- it is not the navigation for your full site. For example, for the Publications page you would list links to Books, Broadsides and Ephemera. You can add and delete links, and change names.<br>
&quot;Add an item&quot; on the lower left. Grab an item by the number and move it to re-arrange the position on the page. Remember to Save Changes- you can use Command-Save.
